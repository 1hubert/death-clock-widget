## How it looks:

## Usage:
- put the skull icon (the 'death clock') on your Desktop
- replace `DEATH_DATE` in line 9 of `death_clock.pyw` with your estimated date of death (there are websites to do that)
- replace `DEATH_CLOCK_PATH` with the actual death clock path
- fill the paths in `ScheduleTask.bat` according to descriptions next to variable names
- run `ScheduleTask.bat` to set a daily scheduled task of updating days left on the death clock (You can manage all of your tasks directly from Windows Task Scheduler)
